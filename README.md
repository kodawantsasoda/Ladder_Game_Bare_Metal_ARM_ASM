# Ladder_Game_Bare_Metal_ARM_ASM
Bare metal Assembly Language program using a Raspberry PI 3B+ (ARM Cortex A-53) and a breadboard.

The goal of the game requires the user to press the button on the breadboard as the LED light turns to the "on" position. As the player succeeds, they will work their way up the "LED ladder." Likewise if they fail, they work their way down the ladder. The higher you are on the LED ladder, the harder it is to make it to the next stage.
